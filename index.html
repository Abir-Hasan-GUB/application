            Dear Prime Minister Trudeau: <br>

            <span class="divider" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 5px 0;"></span>

            We write to urge that the federal government take immediate action to
            strengthen Canada’s bail system to better protect the public and
            Canada’s heroic first responders.<br>

            <span class="divider" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 5px 0;"></span>

            There have been a growing number of calls for changes to prevent
            accused persons, who are out on bail, from committing further criminal
            acts. The justice system fundamentally needs to keep anyone who poses
            a threat to public safety off the streets. And this starts with meaningful
            changes to the Criminal Code, an area solely within the federal
            government’s jurisdiction. <br>

            <span class="divider" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 5px 0;"></span>

            As you know, this was the subject of an intense discussion at the
            October 2022 meeting of Federal-Provincial-Territorial Ministers of
            Justice and Public Safety in Dartmouth. This meeting led to a clear and
            unified call to action for the federal government to reform Canada’s bail
            system. <br>

            <span class="divider" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 5px 0;"></span>

            A reverse onus on bail must be created for the offence of possession of a
            loaded prohibited or restricted firearm in s. 95 of the Code. A person
            accused of a s. 95 offence should have to demonstrate why their
            detention is not justified when they were alleged to have committed an
            offence where there was imminent risk to the public, as is already the
            case with several offences involving firearms. A review of other
            firearms-related offences is also warranted to determine whether they
            should also attract a reverse onus on bail.<br>

            <span class="divider" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 5px 0;"></span>

            This is just one proposal for much-needed reform, and we would
            welcome the opportunity to work with you and your government on this
            pressing and important issue. As premiers, we will continue to do
            everything in our power to keep the public safe, and it is our hope the
            federal government will do the same. With that in mind, we are once
            again calling on the federal government to make this change and commit
            to a thorough review of the bail system in Canada. The public safety of
            Canadians and our heroic first responders cannot wait. The time for
            action is now.<br>

            <span class="divider" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 5px 0;"></span>
